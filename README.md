# Password-Generator by Huber Heats

## Description

This website provides an Password Generator application that generates a random password based on the users selection.

The user can select:
* Password length (8-128 characters long)
* Complexity of password, whether the password contains:
    * Lower case letters
    * Upper case letters
    * Numbers
    * Special characters

The application has data validation built in to help guide the user to provide required parameters to generate a password
Once parameters are defined, the password generator will produce the output within the webpage for the user to use.

Note: this password generator has been updated from baseline code that was provided to me

The password generator was developed with the below user story and acceptance criteria.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
